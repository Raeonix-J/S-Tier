> _“Not perfect. Not flawless. Just unforgettable.”_

## 📌 What Is S Tier?

**S Tier** is not about hype.  
It’s not about budget.  
It’s not about review scores.

> **S Tier is where games change how you think about games.**

These are experiences that:
- Stay with you long after you stop playing
- Set benchmarks others chase
- Feel *alive*, not manufactured

---

## 🚫 What S Tier Is NOT

Before defining S Tier, let’s clear the noise.

S Tier is **not**:
- The most popular game
- The highest-selling title
- The most polished experience
- A game without flaws

Perfection is optional.  
**Impact is mandatory.**

---

## 🧠 Core Requirements of S Tier

A game must meet **most** of these to qualify.

---

### 🔥 1. Mechanical Identity

An S-Tier game has mechanics you can recognize instantly.

- You can describe it without naming it
- Copycats appear after it
- Its systems feel intentional, not safe

> If you remove the skin, the game still stands.

---

### 🧪 2. Systems Over Scripts

S-Tier games trust players.

They:
- Encourage experimentation
- Allow emergent gameplay
- Reward curiosity and mastery

You don’t just **play** the game —  
you **interact** with it.

---

### 🧭 3. Player Respect

An S-Tier game assumes intelligence.

- Minimal hand-holding
- Failure teaches, not punishes
- Mastery feels earned

It doesn’t rush you.  
It doesn’t beg for attention.

---

### 🌍 4. World With Presence

The world doesn’t exist for decoration.

It:
- Pushes back
- Feels hostile, lonely, or alive
- Responds to your actions

You feel like a **visitor**, not the center of the universe.

---

### 🎯 5. Cohesive Vision

Every system serves the same goal.

- Mechanics support tone
- Art supports gameplay
- Music supports pacing

Nothing feels accidental.  
Nothing feels stitched together.

---

### 🕰️ 6. Timelessness

S-Tier games **age differently**.

- They remain playable years later
- Their ideas don’t expire
- They inspire discussion long after release

Graphics fade.  
**Design endures.**

---

## ⚠️ Flaws Are Allowed (Even Expected)

Many S-Tier games are rough.

They may have:
- Clunky UI
- Dated visuals
- Steep learning curves
- Niche appeal

But their **strengths outweigh their weaknesses** so heavily that the flaws become footnotes.
